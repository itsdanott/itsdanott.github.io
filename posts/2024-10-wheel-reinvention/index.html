                During Wheel Reinvention Jam 2024 I started learning the odin programming language by making a level editor.

                <p>Some of the features that made it into the project during and after the jam:</p>
                <p>* Adding AABB Brushes</p>
                <p>* Checker Grid Renderer</p>
                <p>* Raycasts on AABB Faces</p>
                <p>* AABB Brush Face Editing</p>
                <p>* Adding Textures via Drag & Drop</p>
                <p>* Generating GL Texture Array</p>
                <p>* Assigning Textures to Faces</p>

                <h3>Why Odin?</h3>
                <p>This slide didnt make it into the already lengthy recap video</p>

                <p>I'm a game developer with experience in Unity (C#) and Unreal (C++). After working with these engines for a while, I moved on to building my own custom engines.</p>

                <p>Unreal's approach—relying heavily on macros, templates, and custom language features—differs significantly from standard C++. To deepen my understanding, I began working with C++ directly, using OpenGL.</p>
                    
                <p>As my projects grew more complex, I found compilation times becoming a major bottleneck (not to mention the overhead of the C++ standard library) and noticed some architectural issues—largely due to my own inexperience. My experience with C++ was mixed: on one hand, development felt direct and efficient; on the other, I grew increasingly frustrated with the syntax complexity and implicit functionality that sometimes led to unexpected behavior.</p>
                    
                <p>So, I shifted to C for the next phase, aiming to minimize dependencies (using only GLFW, OpenGL, stb, cgltf, and miniaudio) and even writing my own math functions for OpenGL. After a few months, I found I enjoyed C's simplicity, manual memory management, and faster compile times. However, I did miss some of the safety and modern standards that make certain tasks—like string handling—more efficient.</p>
                    
                <p>This led me to consider exploring Odin - a low-level language that offers a more modern alternative to C.</p>
